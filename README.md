# Designing database to efficiently store and retrieve massive amounts of data

### Ultimate Goal: 
* My plan is to deeply study the existing methods of handling large amounts of data in databases, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and propose an optimal combination of strategies that can deliver better performance in terms of data storage, retrieval, fault tolerance, and IO optimization. This could involve novel database schema designs, innovative use of data structures and algorithms, or hybrid approaches combining the best aspects of both relational and NoSQL databases.
